## Requirements

Before installing the system, review the following hardware and software
requirements and make sure that they are complied with. Non-compliance
of the minimum requirements might produce unacceptable performance and
unsatisfactory user experience. A bad user experience is a potential
issue that might lead to adoption resistance.

### Hardware

The minimum hardware requirements are:

-   **Application/Database Server**

    -   Intel Xeon Quad-Core Processors or equivalent

    -   4GB Physical Memory

    -   500GB Hard Disk

    -   100Mbps/1Gbps Network Interface Card

-   **Workstation Computers**

    -   Dual-Core Processor

    -   2GB Physical Memory

    -   100Mbps/1Gbps Network Interface Card

    -   1024 x 768 Screen Resolution

-   **Epson LQ-300+ Dot Matrix Printer** – for collectors. One (1)
    printer per collector

-   **DeskJet or LaserJet Printer** – used for the printing of reports.

-   **Local Area Network** – the network should interconnect the
    Treasurer's Office, Assessor's Office, Land Tax Division, Business
    Permit and Licensing Division, Accounting and the Mayor's Office.

**Note:** The number of desktop computers depends on the number of
users. A minimum setup might be composed of the following: 3 units for
the Treasurer's Office, 2 units for the Business Permit and Licensing, 3
units for the Assessor's Office, 1 unit for Land Tax and 1 unit for the
Mayor's Office.

### Software

Since E-TRACS is implemented using Open-Source Technologies, the LGU has
the option to use open-source software thereby eliminating or minimizing
the cost for software licenses and fees. The following software are
required:

-   Java SDK Version 1.6

-   MySQL 5.0

-   Server Operating System

    -   Windows 2008 Server

    -   Linux Server

-   Workstation Computers

    -   Windows XP, Windows 7 or 8

    -   Linux Desktop

MS SQL Server 2008, this database can still be used maximizing its
investments.
