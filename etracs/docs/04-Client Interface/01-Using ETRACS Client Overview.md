# Using ETRACS Client

## Overview

This section describes the basic elements of the ETRACS client to
familiarize the user on the user interface.

## The Registration Screen

If you are using the system for the first time, this screen will appear.
Click on **Register new terminal** and ask for an available terminal key

Once registered, this screen should not appear anymore. If for some
reason, this appears, and you know this is already registered, try
**Recover existing Terminal.** If it cannot be solved, the network
settings may have changed. You may need to ask the admin for a new
terminal key and register it again.

## The Login Screen

The login screen is the first screen you will always see. It will
require you to enter your username and password. If you want to log in
to another org, you must specify the org code in the client code. Ask
the system administrator regarding the organization codes.
