## Administrator Account

The “sa” or system administrator account is the only account recognized
by the system right out of the box. Only the system administrator at
this time can add the users and define roles. There is a capability to
delegate an administrator’s task but because it is a little complicated,
this is not being supported at the moment. However it will eventually be
added in future versions of the software.

### Terminal Registration

Run the client. Since this terminal is not yet registered, the system
will require you to register a terminal. Choose **Register new
Terminal**. In the terminal key enter **T001** and in the registered by,
add your name. If successful the login screen will appear.

### Logging-In

In the login screen, enter the following:

>Username: **sa**

>Password: !1234\#

If credentials are correct, the system will prompt you to change your
password. Specify a password that is hard to guess. If you forget your
password, it will be reset in the backend.

## Managing Terminals

Terminal keys are randomly–generated keys. This is given to the computer
during terminal registration. The terminal key is associated against the
network interface cards MAC address after successful registration. This
association will never change unless the NIC is replaced or damaged or
the terminal key is deleted from the database. Before registration the
Mac Address next to the terminal key is blank. After successful
registration, the Mac Address should appear which means this terminal
key cannot be used anymore. If you want to replace the mac address,
click on Unassign and give the terminal key to another client for
registration.
