## Managing Rules

Starting from version 2.5, the rule authoring interface is standardized
so that each rule author from different business domains will have a
similar interface. For better management, rules are organized into
groups known as *rulesets*. Rulesets are sets of rules for a certain
function or area where rules are to be applied. For example business
assessment, rpt billing and business billing are different rulesets. To
view this in the system go to **Main Menu** &gt; **Rule Management.**
Under this would be the domain, and rulesets for each domain are
displayed. See diagram below:

To manage these rulesets, position the mouse to the specific ruleset and
double click to open the list of rules for the ruleset. See diagram
below:

<img src="images\image126.png" style="width:4.88143in;height:2.752in" />

The Ruleset title shows the ruleset name. The toolbar contains some
actions to manage rules:

**Close** – closes the window

**New** – creates a new rule

**Open** – Opens the selected rule from the list

> **Refresh** – refreshes the list if new rules are added in case the
> new rule does not appear in the list
>
> **Analyzer** – shows the analyzer or tester for the rules. The
> analyzer is ruleset specific which means there is another analyzer for
> another ruleset.
>
> **Tools** – miscellaneous intended for use for developers
>
> **Rule Groups** – shows the rulegroups for this particular ruleset.
> Selecting a rulegroup shows the rules under the certain rule group.
> Rule groups are discussed further in Rule Groups section.
>
> **State** – shows which rules are draft, deployed, or approved. Draft
> means rule is still not finished. Deployed are active rules while
> approved are approved rules but not deployed.
>
> **Title** – search facility based on title
>
> **Tools** – displays a drop down menu of support functions. Of
> particular importance is the Reload function. In case there are errors
> when authoring rules.

The rule list view shows a listing of the rules that match the filter
above. It shows the following columns – name of rule, title, the
salience or priority of execution, the status, the rulegroup associated,
the rule author, date created and effectivity date. The highlighted line
is the selected line. The details of the selected line is shown below
the list. The rule details show the information regarding the rule.

To open a rule, select or highlight a rule then double click the mouse
or click on the **Open** button from the toolbar. This will open the
rule info screen. The English-like expression is displayed to be easily
understandable.

### Adding a new rule

To add a new rule, click on New from the Rule List View. Specify the
rule name and description of the rule. The rulegroup can be changed.
Rule groups determine which section or compartment in the rule engine it
will execute. (For more about rule groups, go to ***Rule Groups***
section).

<img src="images\image128.png" style="width:2.74107in;height:1.768in" />

Specify the rule name, rule set and rule group and a short description
of what this rule does. The rule name does not accept spaces in between
so it automatically adds an underscore instead of spaces. The rule name
must be unique within the ruleset. Click `Next` when completed. This will
imimagestely save this rule in the database and displays the rule
authoring screen.

Figure 22 Rule Authoring Screen

The Rule Toolbar contains functions for the rule authoring screen.

**Edit** –is used for editing the general info, i.e. the ruleset,
rulegroup , salience and effectivity dates.

**Deploy** - is used to activate the rules. Unless the rule is deployed,
the rule will not take effect.

**Delete** – is used to permanently delete this rule. If the rule is
deployed, then it cannot be deleted. Undeploy first before deleting.

**View Rule** – is used to view the generated rule. This is used for
debugging support.

The rule authoring buttons include the following:

**Add Condition** – adds a new condition

**Add Action** - adds a new action

**Refresh** – In case the rule does not reflect on the expression panel,
click on refresh

### Adding Condition

To add conditions, click on the `Add Condition button`. Select a fact from
the available list and click `Next`.

<img src="images\image130.png" style="width:2.77917in;height:2.65517in" />

Next step is to build constraints from the fact selected. If you want to
reference this fact in other constraints or actions, specify a variable
name. This can be any name you can assign. To add a constraint click on
the `Add` link.

<img src="images\image131.png" style="width:3.21917in;height:1.88692in" />

This will display a list of fields within this fact. Select a field used
for the constraint. The criteria will depend on the type of data of the
field. For example, if the field chosen is a Boolean (true or false)
then the criteria will be limited to true or false type of entries, if
decimal or integer, it will display number values and conditions, for
lookups, it will show a lookup screen.

<img src="images\image132.png" style="width:2.81917in;height:1.78784in" />

After selecting the fields, you can now set the constraints. A
constraint consists of the fieldname, an operator for comparing, and the
constraint value. The operator is dependent on the data type of the
field i.e. a Boolean field will have a different operator for numbers
like decimal and integer.

<img src="images\image133.png" style="width:3.64939in;height:1.8in" />

You can add as many constraints. You can also add fields which you can
assign a variable name to so it can be used in the succeeding constraint
or action. If you made an error and you want to remove the constraint,
just click on the
<img src="images\image134.png" style="width:0.17133in;height:0.184in" />
so it can be removed. Once you have finished completing the constraints
click `OK`. The result will show in the rule expression panel.

<img src="images\image135.png" style="width:2.29117in;height:1.68532in" />

You can remove this constraint by clicking the `Remove` link. To edit the
constraint, click Edit.

### Add Actions

To add actions, click on Add Action button. Select an action from the
displayed list. Click next when completed.

<img src="images\image136.png" style="width:1.93117in;height:2.71137in" />

The parameters of the action depends on the type of action selected. For
example for computation type of actions, a formula field is displayed.

<img src="images\image137.png" style="width:2.95517in;height:2.3602in" />

The amount in this example can be expressed as a formula or as a table.
A formula field enables you to write formulas for computing the value.
To open the formula editor click on the fX button.

<img src="images\image138.png" style="width:3.97917in;height:2.37435in" />

To provide more expressive formulas, you can even write short scripts
called *groovy* scripts. The groovy scripting engine is an open-source
scripting language for java. You can use variables declared in the
condition part included in your formula. When action is completed, press
`OK` to save the formula. At this point, when everything is complete, you
can deploy the rule.

### Testing

You need to test the rules so that you will not have problems later. To
check, go to the rule list view and see if there is an analyzer
attached. If there is, then this rule can be tested. The following an
example of the Business Assessment Rule Analyzer. Because analyzers or
simulators are specific to the domain, it will not be discussed here.

### Handling Errors

There are instances when errors occur that causes all other rules to not
execute properly. It is sometimes caused by not well constructed rules
which was not handled properly by the system. In this case, the entire
ruleset cache must be cleared and reloaded. To do this, go the rule view
list and click on **Tools.**

> <img src="images\image140.png" style="width:1.21917in;height:1.19553in" />

Click on the reload button and wait for a few seconds to reload the
ruleset. This may take time depending on the number of rules deployed. A
message will be displayed indicating the process was completed.

## Summary

This section introduced the rules and general usage of the rule
interface. The next chapters will discuss each of their specific rules
and their application.
