## Online Transaction Processing

The Online Transactions are now strictly implemented using workflow
processes within the assessor’s department. The workflow process
implements a total computerization solution allowing all stakeholders to
perform their tasks electronically with the goal of eliminating manual
steps.

To achieve this objective, an electronic FAAS record is created which is
then forwarded from workflow steps. In each step, applicable information
are then added until the FAAS data is completed.

The advantages of having fully computerized transactions are:

-   Actual workflow processes are fully implemented

-   Data are encoded by the actual personnel and not by encoders

-   Check and balance are fully supported.

-   Workloads are easily monitored

-   Transaction and personnel efficiency can be analyzed and monitored

### Basic Workflow Processes

The basic workflow processes is shown below. Its starts with the
**Receiver/Examiner** accepting the documents required for the
transaction. The required documents are then verified and validated. A
FAAS record is then created with all support documents added. The record
is then forwarded for examination. The **Examiner** schedules the
property for examination and performs ocular inspection. The ocular
inspection finding is then reflected. The record is then forwarded to
**Taxmapper** where it is taxmap and approved by the **Taxmapper
Chief/Head**. The FAAS is then appraised by the **Appraiser**. After
verification by the **Appraisal Chief/Head**, the record is forwarded to
the **Assistant Assessor** for approval. The record is then approved and
submitted to the **Assessor** who then approves the record. The approve
FAAS is forwarded to the **Records** section and the support documents
are attached digitally by scanning or photograph.

1.  To process an online transaction such as Transfer of Ownership,
    double-click on the **Transactions -&gt; Assessor -&gt; Online -&gt;
    Transfer of Ownership** item. This will display the Transaction
    Initial Information screen.

> <img src="images\image203.png" style="width:2.26282in;height:1.73728in" />

2.  Search the Property to process and then click `Next` to validate
    and create the FAAS record and display the main workflow screen.

> <img src="images\image204.png" style="width:4.8796in;height:2.72434in" />
>
> The main screen is divided into two parts, namely:

-   **Section Pane** – the section pane displays an information category
    or section such as General Info, Requirements and etc. The section
    list varies depending on the type of transaction and permission of
    the user. Most sections are displayed. A section data is editable if
    the user has a permission to modify the data.

-   **View Pane –** the view pane is located directly to the right of
    the section pane. It displays the user interface for the selected
    section.

3.  Click on the Section assigned to you and modify the data as needed.

4.  Click on `Submit` to forward the record to the next workflow
    process.

### Assigning a Workflow Process 

The workflow process has built-in notification system (for member LGU
only) that notifies the respective users when a new transaction is
available for processing as shown below:

<img src="images\image205.png" style="width:3.58705in;height:2.02528in" />

The notified user then accepts the record by clicking on the `Assign To
Me` button. Once assigned, the system tracks the record until it is
forwarded to the next workflow step. These steps are repeated until the
record is approved.

### Subdivision

Subdivision is the process of dividing an area of land into two or more
lots. Before performing the subdivision transaction the required
documents must be completed and verified such as the approved
subdivision plan, authority to sell from HLURB, certified true copies of
TCT, realty tax clearances and etc. The property to be subdivided must
be fully paid and has no pending obligations to the LGU. The subdivision
can only be approved if the mother land's area is equal to the total
land area of the subdivided lots. The system does not allow partial
subdivision. This eliminates inaccurate status between the mother land
and the subdivided lots.

During subdivision, all improvements will be manually assigned to one of
the newly subdivided lots in the subdivision. This avoids the problem of
an improvement still referencing a cancelled or retired land. Upon
approval, the tax declarations and real property unit records of these
land improvements be cancelled and new ones will be created and issued
to it.

consolidated must be fully paid and has no pending obligations to the
LGU. The owner of the newly consolidated land can be one of the owners
of the land comprising the consolidation.

During consolidation, all improvements under each consolidated lands
