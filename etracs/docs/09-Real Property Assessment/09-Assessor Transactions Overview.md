## Assessor Transactions

This chapter discusses the procedure on how to perform the different
transactions relevant to the FAAS document. The FAAS is the main output
document associated with the real property assessment. The main
objective during the assessment process is the classification, appraisal
and assessment of real property for taxation purposes as governed by the
provisions of RA No.7160 and its implementing rules and regulations and
other pertinent laws.

The FAAS and its associated document such as Real Property and Real
Property Units have four (4) possible states in the system. These are
the following:

-   **Interim** – signifies that the document is still editable and not
    yet approved. Documents with this state are not considered official
    and hence cannot be referenced by any of the transactions.

-   **For Approval** – the document is awaiting for approval. This state
    is normally associated with the Data Capture transaction.

-   **Current** – the document has already been approved and can be part
    of any transaction. An approved FAAS is also posted to the ledger
    for collection.

-   **Cancelled** – the document has already been cancelled.
    Cancellation is done only through a transaction.

The state of a document changes only when a transaction associated and
approved against it. Transactions are preformed through a workflow
processes enforcing proper delineation of responsibility and promoting
check and balance for every transaction.
