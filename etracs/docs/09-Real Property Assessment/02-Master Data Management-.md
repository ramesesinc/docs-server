## Master Data Management

The Real Property Assessment module requires a number of master files.
These master files must be setup before performing any transaction. It
ranges from simple list of items to settings that require the user to be
familiar with the schedules of market values, adjustments, computations
and formula definition used during assessment. In order to avoid
unnecessary setup issues and problems, the order of which the master
files are created must be followed accordingly as described in the
succeeding sections.
