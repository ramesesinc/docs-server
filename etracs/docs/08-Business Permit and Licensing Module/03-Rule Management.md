## Rule Management

### Overview

There are 3 rule sets in the Business Permits Module as follows:

|                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | 
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BP Info Rules        | This set of rules are executed during the initial gathering of information performed by the Business Information (for some this is the Mayors Office). This usually asks for information required in the Unified Form like no. of employees by gender, business size, etc. This also includes determining the business requirements based on the information given. Information gathered here can also be used in the assessment. |
| Assessment Rules     | This rule set is executed during assessment. This includes asking for additional information to be used in assessing taxes and fees, the calculation of taxes and fees and mapping to certain accounts.                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Billing Rules        | This rule set is executed during preparation of bills to include or exclude surcharges and penalties. This also is executed during receiving of payments (during collection) as it will always compute based on the date.                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
